I have found that getting stuck on a lesson has helped me comprehend the topic better. As I go through a lab I make sure I understand what the task is and I write out the pseudo code to help me focus on what is needed to complete the lesson. There are times that I write out the pseudo code but I am unsure how to code it out. After attempting several times, I review the lesson and try one more time to complete the lab. If I an unsuccesful I step away from my computer and take a 5 min break from coding. This helps me come back to the lab with a clear head and I can attempt the lab once again.
