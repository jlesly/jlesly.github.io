I was at work and I overheard a young man in his early thirties who had just finished a coding boot camp share his experience with a coworker. The conversation piqued my interest and I joined. He mentioned the coding bootcamp had been a challenge for him because he didn't have a background in computer science. He left his full time job to take the course in NYC. I was inspired from his story and that same day I started looking for coding bootcamps in my area. I wasn't able to find a program in my city. The closest program was in Boston or NYC and the programs were expensive and extremely demanding. I couldn't leave my full time job to do a coding bootcamp but I needed to in order to do well in the program. After spending ten years working in different fields I didn't find satisfying and fulfilling, I decided it was time for a change. I signed up for Code Academy's free programs and soaked as much information I could while working full time. I came across the Flatiron School and signed up for the pre-coding bootcamp. I am 2 weeks into the online Software Engineering course and I am very happy I took the leap. I enjoy the challenge of figuring out why something works and why something doesn't work. I am currently working part time but will be quitting soon to dedicate my time solely to the program.  This is an investment in my future and I want to make sure I am in the best position I can be to get a good job.
