I am currently on Module 3 Section 7 and I feel like I've learned an extraordinary amount of information thus far and it's only the beginning. I've found that as I'm going through a lesson I am constantly looking up the topic on other websites to learn more. I have been able to go through the sections with not too much of a struggle. 
Doing the self-paced course has made me feel like I'm living in two different worlds. I do all my work on my computer, attend study sessions online, and interact with other students online. For the first time last week I talked to someone in person about what I was learning and it felt great. I realzied how much I have actually learned over the last month. I live in Hartford and I'm working part time so I haven't taken advantage of the WeWork membership as it is difficult to go during the week due to my work hours. As I continue to work through the program I will make the effort to take advantage of the WeWork membership, attend more study sessions, and network network network. I am excited for what lies ahead and I'm looking forward to tackling the projects.
