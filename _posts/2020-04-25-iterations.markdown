I've been slowly working my way through Section 7 in Module 5 which focuses on iteration. Ruby iterators can be used to call a block once for each item in the array. 

.each
When the .each iterator is used it will return all the elements of an array. Each iterator returns each value one by one. 

.collect or .map
When the .collect or .map iterators are used it will return all the elements of a collection. 

.select 
When the .select iterator is used it will return all the elements for which the specified statement in the block is true.
